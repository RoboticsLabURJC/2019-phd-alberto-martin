# Monte Carlo Control
In Monte Carlo control we will see how to optimize the value function, that is, how to make the value funciton more accurate than the estimation. In the control methods, we follow a new type of iteration called generalized policy iteration, where policy evaluation and policy improvement interact with each other. It basically runs as a loop between policy evaluation and improvement, that is, the policy is always improved with respect to the value function, and the value function is always improved according to the policy. It keeps on doing this. When there is no change, then we can say that the policy and value function have attained convergence, that is, we found the optimal value function and optimal policy.
